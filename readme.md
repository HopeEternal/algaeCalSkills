# AlgaeCal Web Developer Test

Thank you for taking the time to take our test. We're excited to have you as a 
candidate and look forward to reviewing your results!

Tips:

* **Git:** be sure to use expressive messages on your commits
* **Code Quality:** make sure your code is clear to someone who is experienced reading code. 
Use comments sparingly to add clarity where it might be lacking. You can also use add comments
to explain any choices or shortcuts you may have taken since this is a skills test. JS should
follow to AirBnB style guide (although we are not strict on this) https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
